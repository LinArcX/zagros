  # kernel_stack is defined later in the .bss section and represents the base (top) of the stack.
  # This initializes the stack, which is necessary for function calls and local variables in the kernel.
  # The stack grows downward in memory (toward lower addresses) on x86 architectures.
  mov $kernel_stack, %esp

  # Pushes the contents of the %eax and %ebx registers onto the stack.
  # According to the Multiboot Specification, when the bootloader transfers control to the kernel:
  #   - %eax contains the Multiboot magic number (0x2BADB002 for Multiboot 1).
  #   - %ebx contains the physical address of the Multiboot information structure, which includes details like the memory map and loaded modules.
  # These values are pushed onto the stack as arguments to kmain, following the C calling convention:
  #  kmain(uint32_t magic, multiboot_info_t* mb_info)
  #.code32
  #mov %eax, 0xCAFEBABE
  push %eax
  push %ebx
  call kmain

# kernel shouldn't stop. there's an infinite loop at the end of kmain.
# _loop here, is just to make sure we never goes outside of infinite loop.

# the block starting symbol (.bss) is the portion of an object file that contains statically allocated variables that are declared
# but have not been assigned a value yet. Typically only the length of the bss section, but no data, is stored in the object file.
# The program loader allocates memory for the bss section when it loads the program.
# By placing variables with no value in the .bss section, instead of the .data or .rodata section which require initial value data,
# the size of the object file is reduced.
